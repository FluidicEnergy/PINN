Various NS equation Physics-informed Neural Network with Vanila version, predict u, v, p from x, y, t
Check out:
* This repository is  messy and almost of codes not working(but maybe architecutr of codes will be helpful). so you guys check codes for you just one by one
* This repository includes Navier-stokes equation Airfoil and circular cylinder using with DeepXDE(Very basically steady-states version) and Pytorch
* Expecially, DeepONet and KINN(Kolmogorov Arnold informed neural network) frameworks buit by Pytorch
